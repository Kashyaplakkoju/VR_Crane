<h3 align="center">A realistic crane simulation built in Unity with cable physics, gear attachments, and interactive controls</h3>

## 📝 Project Overview

This project simulates a crane mechanism in Unity, featuring realistic cable physics using the FiloCables system. It includes controls for moving the crane horizontally, vertically, and laterally, with dynamic rope length limits and gear attachments (hosting gear and missile mode). The simulation supports audio playback, scene resetting, and visual billboards. Ideal for VR prototypes, engineering simulations, or game development experiments.

- **🔭 Focus:** Crane mechanics, physics-based cables, and gear interactions  
- **🌱 Built with:** Unity's physics engine and custom scripts for crane operations  
- **👯 Open for collaboration:** On improving physics realism or adding VR support  
- **🤝 Looking for help:** With advanced rigging or multiplayer integration  
- **💬 Ask me about:** Unity scripting, physics joints, or cable simulations  
- **⚡ Fun fact:** The crane can "attach" gears dynamically, simulating real-world hosting and missile launches!

## ✨ Features

- **Crane Controls:** Move the crane front/back, left/right, up/down with speed limits and deceleration.
- **Cable Physics:** Using FiloCables for realistic rolling, pinhole, and hybrid cable links.
- **Gear Attachments:** Dynamic modes for hosting gear and missile gear with adjustable rope lengths.
- **Audio & Visuals:** Multi-audio source playback with delays, vertical billboards, and outline enablers.
- **Scene Management:** Scene loading, transitioning, and resetting.
- **Debug Tools:** Collision triggers and gizmos for visualizing movement limits.
- **Editor Tools:** Custom editors for cable discs, points, sections, and shapes.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Kashyaplakkoju/VR_Crane.git
    ```
2. **Open in Unity**
    - Use Unity Hub or open the folder directly in your compatible Unity Editor version.
    - Recommended: Unity 2020.3 or higher.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    - [FiloCables](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/filo-the-cable-simulator-133620) for cable simulation.
    - [TextMeshPro](usually included in modern Unity installs).

4. **Import Models**
    - Blender models are included in the `/Models` directory. You can modify or replace as needed.

5. **Run the Scene**
    - Open the main scene (`Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`) and press Play!

## 🚀 Usage

- Use the in-game controls or keyboard mappings to operate the crane.
- Switch between gear modes for hosting and missile operations.
- Adjust cable lengths, move the crane, and trigger audio/visual effects.
- Reset the scene to try different configurations.
